# SDI-Project-TV-Guide

-A simple website that allows the user to search for a show and see all relevant information about a show of their choosing.

-This website displays the top ten shows from the TV Maze API on the first page. On the first page, you can click on 
any one to see all the relevant information on that show on a subsequent page. On that information page, you can use a 
dropdown menu that displays all the seasons of that show and when you click on a season, it then takes you to another page 
to see all the episodes in that season with a brief summary for each episode.
